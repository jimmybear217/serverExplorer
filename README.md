# Server Explorer

this one-file script is meant to help us gather as much information as possible
on a target server as well as injecting shell and database commands leaving minimal
trace and taking as little space as possible
and especially without making a single log entry from itself.
This is a remake of my original 2017 script sever_explorer.
